## Introduction
The **Image Upload System** is a web-based platform that enables users to upload images anonymously. It incorporates advanced security measures to prevent steganography, ensures moderated content, and provides a safe gallery for viewing approved images.

### Purpose
To provide a secure and user-friendly platform for anonymous image uploads with robust moderation capabilities and strong risk management strategies.

---

## Features
- **Anonymous Image Uploads**: No user account required.
- **Image Moderation**: Ensures only appropriate images are displayed.
- **Steganography Prevention**: Advanced techniques to detect and block hidden data.
- **Secure Architecture**: Designed with modern web technologies and risk management methodologies.
- **Dockerized Environment**: Easy to deploy and scale.

---

## Architecture
The system follows a modern architecture using a microservices approach:

### Components
1. **Frontend**:
   - Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript
   - Provides an intuitive user interface for uploading and viewing images.

2. **Backend**:
   - Developed in Python (Flask).
   - Handles image processing, validation, and database interactions.

3. **Database**:
   - PostgreSQL for secure and efficient data storage.

4. **Docker Orchestration**:
   - Managed with `docker-compose` to ensure seamless integration of services.

5. **Moderation System**:
   - Automated tools and human moderators for content validation.

## Setup and Installation
### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- Node.js and npm for frontend development (optional).
- Python 3.x for backend development (optional).

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project
   ```

2. Build and start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:5500`
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:8000`

4. (Optional) Populate the database with initial data using the provided scripts.

---

## Usage
### Uploading Images
1. Open the application in a browser.
2. Click on the **Upload Image** button.
3. Select an image and submit.
4. Wait for moderation approval.

### Viewing Approved Images
1. Navigate to the gallery page.
2. Browse the moderated images.

---

## Security Considerations
1. **Steganography Prevention**:
   - Images are scanned to detect hidden data.
2. **Moderation**:
   - AI-powered tools and manual checks ensure safe content.
3. **Anonymous Usage**:
   - No personally identifiable information is collected.
4. **Risk Management Framework**:
   - Methodologies like STRIDE and DREAD are applied.

---

## Risk Management
### STRIDE Analysis
- **Spoofing**: Secure authentication for moderators.
- **Tampering**: Images are hashed to detect alterations.
- **Repudiation**: Detailed logs of uploads and actions.
- **Information Disclosure**: Encrypted storage and transmission.
- **Denial of Service**: Rate limiting and resource allocation.
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Role-based access control for moderators.

### DREAD Evaluation
- Regularly assess the impact and likelihood of potential threats.

---

## Future Enhancements
1. **AI Moderation**:
   - Improve automated moderation with machine learning.
2. **Enhanced Analytics**:
   - Provide insights into uploaded images and user behavior.
3. **Mobile Support**:
   - Fully responsive design for seamless mobile usage.
